Description: Enable R users to use Auptimizer
    <https://github.com/LGE-ARC-AdvancedAI/auptimizer> for hyperparameter 
    optimization (HPO).  Auptimizer helps data scientists to easily apply HPO 
    in their work and to speed up model training jobs by executing jobs 
    asynchronously when computing resources are available.
