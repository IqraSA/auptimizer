# HPO for Deep Neural Networks

Demonstration using https://github.com/han-cai/EAS

The HPO engine is integrated into the Auptimizer.
The running script is a modification of `client.py`.

Run it as

    cd eas
    python -m aup experiment.json

Notice that the start_nets is needed in this folder although the experiment is running in the eas folder
