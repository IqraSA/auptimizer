# Compression utility functions

This example provides an example training script ``mnist.py``, where the compression utility functions sensitivity analysis and channel dependency analysis are applied. To just use these utility functions, there is no need to launch an Auptimizer experiment. The analysis outputs will be saved to folder ``output``.
